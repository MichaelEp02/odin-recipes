<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>2 tbsp cooking oil</li>
        <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C. Melt the butter in a large bowl in the microwave (or in a saucepot and then transfer to a bowl).</li>
        <li>Add the cooking oil and cocoa powder to the melted butter and whisk until smooth.</li>
        <li>Whisk the sugar into the chocolate mixture until evenly incorporated, then whisk in the eggs, vanilla extract, and salt.</li>
        <li>Stir in the flour until it forms a thick batter. Finally, fold in the chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Prepare an 8x8-inch baking dish by coating it with butter or non-stick spray,
        then laying in a piece of parchment paper (the paper does not need to cover all sides of the dish).
        Add the brownie batter to the prepared dish, then spread it out evenly.</li>
        <li>Bake the brownies in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. The brownies will be quite soft and moist, even when fully baked.</li>
        <li>Remove the brownies from the oven and let them cool for 10 minutes before lifting them out of the baking dish. Slice into nine pieces and serve.</li>
    </ol>
